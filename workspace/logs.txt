  To implement a model that determines the optimum charging times based on live and historical data, we'll follow
  these steps:

   1 Calculate the distance between each car and all charging stations to find the nearest station for each car.
   2 Use the historical charging rates data to predict the future charging rates for the nearest station of each car.
   3 Determine the optimum charging time for each car based on the predicted charging rates.

  First, let's calculate the distance between each car and all charging stations to find the nearest station for each
  car. We'll use the Euclidean distance formula for this calculation.

  To integrate the utility with the simulator and optimize EV charging costs, we need to follow these steps:

   1 Predict Future Charging Rates: Use the historical charging rates data to predict future charging rates for the
     nearest station of each car. This step involves building or using a predictive model.
   2 Determine Optimum Charging Time: Based on the predicted charging rates, determine the optimum charging time for
     each car. This could involve finding the time slot with the lowest predicted charging rate.
   3 Integrate with Simulator: Implement the utility in a way that it can run alongside the simulator, fetching live
     data, making predictions, and providing recommendations on the optimum charging times.

  Let's start with the first step, predicting future charging rates for the nearest station of each car. We will use a
  simple approach for this demonstration, assuming that the future charging rate can be predicted based on the average
  rate of the past hours for each station. This is a simplification and in a real-world scenario, more sophisticated
  models could be used.
